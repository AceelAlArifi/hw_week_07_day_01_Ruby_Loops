## Easy Going
1. Write a for loop that will log the numbers 1 through 20.

## Get Even
1. Write a for loop that will log only the even numbers in 0 through 200.

## Wild Wild Life
Use the following arrays to answer the questions below (name, species ,age, hometown):
You should be modifying the elements by accessing them. It is up to you which methods to use. 

```ruby
wolfy = ["Wolfy", "wolf", 16, "Yukon Territory"]
sharky = ["Sharky", "shark", 20, "Left Coast"]
plantee = ["Plantee", "plant",  5000 , "Mordor"]
porgee = ["Porgee", "Porg", 186, "Ahch-To"]
dart = ["D'Art" , "Demogorgan Dog", 2, "Upside Down"]
```
1. Plantee just had her birthday; change Plantee's array to reflect her being a year older.

2. Change Wolfy's hometown from "Yukon Territory" to "Gotham City".

3. Give D'Art a second hometown by adding "Hawkins"

4. Porgee decides that Wolfy can't be named "Wolfy" anymore. Replace "Wolfy" from the `wolfy` array with "Gameboy".

## Yell at the Ninja Turtles
1. Create an array with the members of the ninja turtles (Donatello, Leonardo, Raphael, Michaelangelo)

2. Capitalize each one of them and print out the result.


## More Arrays

```ruby
favMovies = ['Jaws', 'The Fellowship of the Ring', 'Howl\'s Moving Castle', 'Django Unchained', 'Cloud Atlas', 'The Usual Suspects', 'Toy Story', 'Conan the Barbarian', 'Titanic', 'Harry Potter', 'Fried Green Tomatoes', 'Volver', 'Oculus', 'Seven', 'Black Panther', 'Imitation of Life', 'Snatch', 'Fast and Furious'];
```
    
 1. Sort the array
 1. Reverse it 
 1. Use the method `pop`
 1. `push` "Guardians of the Galaxy" 
 1. Remove `Jaws`
 1. Add this array ```["Spiderman","Thor","Ant-Man"]``` to `favMovies` 
 1. Check if the array includes `"Imitation of Life"` if it does print "already here", else add it to the array.
 1. Print your final results to the console

## Where is Waldo

* With the following multi-dimensional array

```ruby
whereIsWaldo = [["Timmy", "Frank"], "Eggbert",
                    ["Lucinda", "Jacc", "Neff", "Snoop"],
                    ["Petunia", ["Baked Goods", "Waldo"]]];
```
* Remove Eggbert 
* Change "Neff" to "No One"
* Access and print "Waldo"

## Excited Kitten
1. Write code that logs "Love me, pet me! HSSSSSS!" 20 times.

2. For every **even** number in your loop, log "...human...why you taking pictures of me?...".

## A New Friend

1. Create a loop that prints `Hello` forever unless the user inputs `Goodbye`
